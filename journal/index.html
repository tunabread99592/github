        <p>I really liked this article because it explained things that my UI/UX class didn't. We briefly introduced why copy was important, and better ways to phrase the same things, but never had an explicit lesson. I accidently made a lot of the wrong decisions, but do remember hemming and hawing over the alternative without having a reason to decide for either. This felt like that itemized list of answers that I needed.</p>

        <p>For instance, input boxes: where to put the label, length of the box, and formatting requirements. I remember inserting my labels into the box to save space, but didn't realize that tabbing through options could make users forget the topic. Saving space becomes less of a priority than usability.</p>

        <p>Screenreaders are also a really interesting topic to me since I never had to focus on accessibility. I'm glad the internet is becoming more inclusive, it just makes me approach my own workflow differently. I feel my generational place shifting as I witness the web changing rather than growing up with it.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.lemonade.com/onboarding/1">Lemonade Insurance</a> does a great job making onboarding fun. The steps are laid out clearly, but breaks down each question into its own page. You can also scroll up too see past questions while refraining from seeing future ones like a live chat system.</p>
